I have lived in the Bay Area my entire life (Windsor → Berkeley → San Francisco → ??). To make up for the sheltered life I have lived I have overcompensated with adrenaline filled activities including skydiving, cave diving, canyoneering, paragliding, motorcycling, and as you can see below... bungee jumping.

## My Expertise

The obsessions that are not captured in my [LinkedIn](linkedin.com/in/stogers), but are what make me human.

#### Product

As an engineer and product manager I have built and led both the last 10% and the zero-to-one products. My biggest takeaway is that whether it's incremental or iterative, the most important thing to do is move forward.

Feel free to jump over to my [Projects](/projects) to dive deeper!

#### Machine learning

I received my masters in computer science, with a focus in AI. I like to think that in helping make computers smarter, I am also building some clout with the robots for the inevitable singularity. 

#### Education

From tutoring math in high school to teaching computer science at UC, Berkeley, I have always had a passion for teaching others. I personally am so obsessed with learning and personal growth, that I strive to help others achieve both in any way I can.

* Leader and Mentor of Onboarding Program - Pinterest
* Teacher for Introduction to Computer Science - UC Berkeley
* CS Tutor at Self-Paced Center - UC Berkeley
* Math Tutor at Afterschool Program - High School

#### Public Speaking

I have extensive experience speaking in front of large crowds and while I am not formally trained by any means, I tend to engage audiences better than most. I had the unique opportunity of hosting Q&As with the CEO every Friday at Pinterest, where I would MC various sections of the happy hour in front of thousands of employees.

## My Hobbies

#### Sports
I love being active and competitively played sports since the age of 4, starting with softball, to volleyball, and more recently club ultimate frisbee on [Vampires](https://play.usaultimate.org/teams/events/Eventteam/?TeamId=fhbq3%2f9CD8Rxr%2f0e3UitJF3LMT7PQ6596QTq65rtDp0%3d). I think team sports have shaped who I am as a person, but I won't regurgitate my lame college application essay here. 

#### Board Games
Because I was never allowed to play video games, I developed a love for board games. My current favorite is a cooperative game called [Spirit Island](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/162886/spirit-island). I have been part of a D&D campaign that has lasted over two years now, roleplaying a character that slowly has bled over into my actual personality. 

#### Traveling
My first time flying in an airplane was when I was 18 years old. I have now been to over 40 countries. Favorite was Thailand and my next up is Scandinavia.
